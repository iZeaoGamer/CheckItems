### Description
Want to have a plugin, where you can check other's inventories - Without the need of taking other player's items, and without needing of asking what items they have? Look no more! With this plugin, you can simply use /checkitems <player>, where you can check for other players items in their inventory, using the virion InvMenu.
It's pretty straight forward.
  Keep in mind - This plugin has been currently untested, so some features within this plugin may not work as intended.
